## Big Frame o' Data

`bfd` is a small project that aims to handle big data. Big for memory, not for hard drives. It is mostly a learning
exercise but it may turn into something more useful. The `fst` package will hopefully fill the vacuum of R
packages that can chunk over on-disk data, but until then `bfd` is no big deal.

## Classes

`bfd` has a set of reference classes that handle writing and reading vectors of all R's base types. These are
created using the `make_bfdcol` generic function:

```{r}
library(bfd)

data(iris)
df <- bfd(iris, path = "iris.bin", overwrite = TRUE)

df

```

## Indexing operation

```{r}
df$Species[1:10]

head(df)
tail(df)

df[1:10, c(1,4)]
```


## Combining bfds

These functions will eventually be called from `rbind` and `cbind` equivalents:

```{r}

df <- combine.bfds(df, df)

df

```
